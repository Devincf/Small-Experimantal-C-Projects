# Small Experimental C++ Projects

Here I added my collection of all the small/experimental projects I could find on my harddrive. 
Sadly I lost some when I had to wipe my SSD before so there are only weird ones I saved on my HDD.
Some things might be really old and I don't know what exactly I was planning to accomplish back then but I tried to give good explanations for everything.

Also alot of those projects helped me learn/understand/test certain things in the c++ library.



# Projects
Here are all the different projects sorted from most interesting to least interesting ( in my opinion ).
Most of them contain their own readme file but the smaller ones don't

* [multithreading](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/multithreading) - Tried diving into the realms of multithreading within c++ after scrapping alot of other software, sadly didnt do as much as I'd like to
* [Automaton Framework](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/Automaton%20Framework) - Simple implementation of a framework to create nfa/dfa's. Inspired by playing around with a, in my opinion badly made, software to design automatons 
in school and wanting to make my own version of it at home and this was the result.
* [wrapper implementations](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/wrapper%20implementations) - Some implementations of my own wrapper classes.
* [benchmarks](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/benchmarks) - Simple benchmarking framework, nothing more to say.
* [euler](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/euler) - Started working on euler problems got bored really fast though.
* [SudokuSolver](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/SudokuSolver) - Tried creating a sudoku solver, stopped halfway through, needs to be redesigned
* [low level manipulations](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/lowlevelmanipulations) - Don't really know the motivation behind this one, but I played around with passing ptrs around just by memory and also with some inline assembly manipulation of bools and enums. Also tried to understand how vectors allocate space behind the scenes I think.
* [Multithreaded Plusinbased System](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/MultiThreadedPluginBasedSystem) - This was supposed to be a framework for loading plugins(as .dlls), don't really remember what exactly I wanted to multithread but I never did it.
* [logtest](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/logtest) - Experimented with writing a console based logger for windows dont really remember alot about this
* [sortingtests]()https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/sortingtests - Played around with a few sorting algorithms but got bored of it really quick
* [idk](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/idk) - as the title suggests, I really don't know what I wanted to do here *I even used "using namespace std; here.."
