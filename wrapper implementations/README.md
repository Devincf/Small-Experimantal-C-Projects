# Wrapper Implementations

Some implementations of my own wrapper classes.

# Implementations

* [Matrix](https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/wrapper%20implementations/matrix) - Some Matrix classes with templated row/column count and datatype. For a non templated Matrix class check https://github.com/Devincf/Small-Experimantal-C-Projects/tree/master/multithreading/matrixmult


# To-do

* Own implementation for various stl containers
* Own implementation for various datatypes
* Own implementation for a memory allocator
